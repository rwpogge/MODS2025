# dataMan - MODS Data Manager

**Updated: 2025 Oct 31 [rwp/osu]##

Development sandbox for a python-based data manager for the Archon MODS 
system that will post-process raw images taken with MODS.

Post-processing steps include
 * fixing fits header issues
 * logging the images
 * pushing the raw images to the data repository
 * converting raw MEF to standard FITS?
 * inserting telemetry metadata (guider, wfs, weather?) as FITS bintable extensions
 * other?

The idea is to let the azcam server continue taking data moving post-processing "offline" from
the azcam server and the modsCCD interface client.  

This is to replace functions performed by the `modslogger` script executed by the `caliban` data
transfer agents in the pre-2025 MODS data-taking system. Faster machines and greater python
FITS handling capability gives us many more options.

## contents

 * `dataMan_vX.py` - development version of `dataMan`.
 * `dataMan.ini` - yaml runtime configuration file template.
 * `dataMan_server.py` - simple UDP socket server demo, run as `python dataMan_server.py`
 * `clientDemo.py` - simple dm client - run in ipython shell, and use `sendToDM()` to send messages. `quit` will shutdown the server demo

## Notes

### 2025 Oct 31
Working with data headers from live MODS.  Found a few issues that need fixing:
 * DETSEC and CCDSEC headers in extension Q1..4 are incorrect for ROI subframe reads, found a fix
 * CCDTEMP and BASETEMP reported are -999.9 (no read) but Archon status info in HDU5 are good, so can fix with that snapshot
 * Need code to fix blank and NOCOMM header info, but so far haven't seen any, next step is to simulate

First cut before we start getting CCD data with live headers from the MODS.

Back at it after the Archon deploy. Added `threading` to the server for a `proc <filename>` command. Set to 10s to process a "FITS" image.
Ran with the client in an `ipython` shell.  Seems OK, need to start thinking of how to test with live data next.

First cut, very simple client/server pair.  Only command is "quit"

# MODS Instrument Control and Data-Taking System Installation

Needs good installation instructions.  This is a stub to build on

## Preparations

### Make sure you have all ancillary packages, compilers, and libraries ready

```shell
sudo dnf -y install tk tcsh emacs doxygen
sudo dnf -y install readline readline-devel
sudo dnf -y install libmodbus libmodbus-devel
sudo dnf -y install qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtsvg-devel
sudo dnf -y install dnsutils wget (nice, but not required)
```
Also need the local LBTO versions of hdf5 and lbto-libtelemetry, build from local rpms
or the copies in ~/Libs/ in a properly-configured account on the mods machines.

For ICE, follow the instructions at https://www.zeroc.com/ice/downloads/3.7/cpp
```
sudo dnf -y install https://download.zeroc.com/ice/3.7/el9/ice-repo-3.7.el9.noarch.rpm

sudo dnf -y install libice-c++-devel libice3.7-c++ python3-ice
sudo dnf -y install icebox
```
### Create directories we need

In the dts account, make sure that these directories are all present with the correct permission
```shell
mkdir bin
mkdir Logs
chmod 777 Logs
```
And in /home
```shell
cd /home
sudo mkdir data
chmod 777 data
sudo mkdir Logs
chmod 777 Logs
```

### Get the code repo

Code is installed logged in as user `dts` on the Linux server.
```shell
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/rwpogge/MODS2025
```
If you already have a MODS2025 repo, then
```
cd ~/MODS2025
git pull
```
to update your local copy.

### Distribute the code

Yes, this is sloppy, but this is also development mode.  We copy the code we need out of MODS2025/ into the
public space.  Once we're past the development phases this will be a much cleaner build, until then...

#### MODS instrument server (e.g., mods1, mods2):
```shell
cp -r MODS2025/mods .
cp -r MODS2025/ISIS .
cp -r MODS2025/Config .
cp -r MODS2025/modsPerl .
```

Note that we are temporarily overriding the `modsPerl` distribution on the LBTO GitHub repository
while we test and verify updates needed for the Archon controllers.

#### MODS azcam server (e.g., mods1b)

```shell
cp -r MODS2025/mods/Agents .
cp -r MODS2025/ISIS .
cp -r MODS2025/azcam .
cp -r MODS2025/Config .
```

## Build order

### ISIS client and server
```shell
cd ~/ISIS/isisClient
./build
cd ../isisServer
./build
cp isis isisd ~/bin/
```

### MODS agw and mmc Servers
```shell
cd ~/mods
./build
```
Remember to follow the instructions for implementing the 
shared memory sector (`modsalloc` README)

### MODS Agents
```shell
cd ~/mods/Agents
cd lbttcs
./build
cp lbttcs ~/bin/
cd ../modsEnv
../
```
### MODS GUIs
```shell
cd ~/mods/GUIs
qmake --version
   -> if it says "Using Qt version 5.15.2 in /opt/Anaconda3/lib", type
conda deactivate
qmake --version 
   -> it should say "Using Qt version 6.6.2 in /usr/lib64", proceed, otherwise "conda deactivate" again
cd iTerm
qmake -o Makefile
make clean
make
cp iterm ~/bin/
cd ../imsTool
qmake -o Makefile
make clean
make
[No copy to ~/bin/!]
cd ../modsUI
qmake -o Makefile
make clean
make
cp modsUI ~/bin/
```
Remember to do `conda activate` to restore the anaconda environment. For LBT at this 
writing `python --version` should report `Python 3.12.2`.

Note we do not install the imsTool GUI in a public-facing directory as this is for engineering use only.


## Post-Build Installation

### modsalloc systemd service

For the server machines (mods1 and mods2) you need to install and start the `modsalloc` service
to run at boot-time using systemd.

Because the LBTO mountain machines are configured to use SELinux in enforcing mode, we have to take extra installation steps.

After the initial build, go to `/home/dts/mods/malloc` and copy these files to `/usr/local/bin` as root or sudo:
```
% sudo cp modsalloc /usr/local/bin/
% sudo cp modsalloc.sh /usr/local/bin/
% sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/modsalloc.sh
```
Then
```
% cd ../modsalloc
% sudo cp modsalloc.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
```
and enable for boot-time execution:
```
% sudo systemctl enable modsalloc
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/modsalloc.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/modsalloc.service.
```
After the next reboot the `modsalloc` service will be started automatically. 

Before the first reboot, you will need to start the service for the first time:
```
% sudo systemctl restart modsalloc
```

### Other programs

These programs need to be installed in `/usr/local/bin` for use by common data-taking services.  This install step
makes the "release" versions, allowing us to recompile and test new versions without interrupting programs critical
for observing (why we install "by hand" instead of as part of the make process).

```
cd /home/dts/mods/bin
sudo cp vueinfo /usr/local/bin
sudo cp mlcRecover /usr/local/bin
```
(more coming as we converge)

## Data and Telemetry NFS mounts

MODS machines NFS mount two remote observatory drives
 * `/lbt/data/new` - newdata repository
 * `/lbt/data/telemetry` - observatory HDF5 telemetry streams

Two rpms are setup to do this for us, need to be run one-time when a machine is setup
```
sudo dnf install lbto-nfs-mountain-newdata lbto-nfs-mountain-telemetry
```

`modsEnv` writes environmental sensor logs in `/lbt/data/telemetry/instruments/mods#/...` (#=1,2)

## Python

Currently we are using Anaconda Python 3.12 (latest release is 3.12.11 at this writing), and conda 24.9.2

Install of the standard LBTO py312 environment (as root)
```
conda create -y --prefix /usr/local/conda/envs/py312 python=3.12 astropy numpy scipy matplotlib jupyterlab pandas conda-build requests msgpack-python lz4 pymongo colorama
```
Then, still as root, activate py312
```
conda activate /usr/local/conda/envs/py312
```
Python modules we need to add for MODS:
```
pip install pymodbus
```
Zero-C ICE and the LBTO IIF modules:
```
conda install conda-forge::zeroc-ice
pip install --trusted-host yumsrv.tucson.lbto.org --extra-index-url http://yumsrv.tucson.lbto.org/pip/repo lbto-iif
```
All done, ready to go.  This has to be done on all MODS machines to make sure we have the same python
environment as the rest of the observatory machines.

# Engineering Tools

Updated: 2025 Dec 15 [rwp/osu]

Additional tools used while getting the Archons tuned up to work with
the MODS science CCDs.  Some of these may migrate into the main branch

 * `azcam-console` - engineering console for the azcam server
 * `wkhtmltox` - copy of the RPM for a package of HTML to PDF and image tools (  https://wkhtmltopdf.org/). We used `wkthmltox-0.12.6.1-2.almalinux9.x86_64.rpm`

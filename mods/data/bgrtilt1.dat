# holographic bypass gratings.
#
# dA dB and dC are the collimator TTF actuator offsets from the
# nominal grating mode TTF settings listed in the rconfig.ini file.
# Usually the primary grating tilt setting is the reference value, and
# has d(A,B,C)=(0,0,0).  These are the offsets needed to roughly
# center the IMCS laser spot for that order on the quad cell, removing
# a residual rotation between the science and bypass gratings.
#
# The first entry must be the PRIMARY setting, so that it appears
# first in the pull-down menu of preset grating tilts.

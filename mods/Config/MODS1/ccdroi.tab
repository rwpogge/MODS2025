# Format: ModeName xmin xmax ymin ymax
#
# Names must not contain any spaces, convention is XKxYK in unbinned
# pixels, where 1K=1024, 2K=2048, etc.  We use the same ROI modes
# for both channels, hence why there are not separate red and blue
# versions of this file.  However, 3K is 3088, the full active
# height of the e2v CCD231-68 CCDs (16 more than 3072).
#
# A valid ROI must be divisible by 2 to be valid for binning with
# the Archon controllers. Also note that overscan is NOT part of
# the ROI definition, so the number of columns will be larger by
# 64 in the final image, 32 columns per quadrant.
#
# ROIs must also be symmetric about the 4 quadrants.
#
# The Archon controllers support fewer ROI modes
#
# MODS e2v CCD231-68 Full Frame: x=1..8292 y=1..3088 (less overscan)

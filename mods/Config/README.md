# MODS runtime configuration files

Last Update: 2025 Dec 17 [rwp/osu]

This directory contains the active runtime configuration files
for the MODS instrument control programs.  These are the
files we must protect from tampering, so they are kept here
in the code tree instead of the /home/mods/ support directory

## Files:
<pre>
   MODS1/ - folder with the MODS1 mechanism config and tables
   MODS2/ - folder with the MODS2 mechanism config and tables
   IIF/ - folder with IIF config files for the TCS interface
   Retired/ - old ini files no longer used (reference)
</pre>

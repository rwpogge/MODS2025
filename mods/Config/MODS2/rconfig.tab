# Format: 
#  name grating filter cfoc ttfA ttfB ttfC ccdroi xbin ybin xover yover speed
#
# where:
#  grating  = grating name (Flat, G670L, etc.)
#  filter   = filter name or "Any" to keep filter unchanged
#  camfoc   = camera focus in microns
#  ttfa,b,c = nominal collimator TTF actuator position
#  roi      = CCD readout region of interest or "Full" for full-frame
#  xbin     = CCD x-axis (disp) binning factor [one of 1,2,4,8]
#  ybin     = CCD y-axis (slit) binning factor [one of 1,2,4,8]
#  speed    = CCD readout speed: fast or slow
#
# Configuration names must not contain spaces, and are ideally 8
# characters or less.  The names Imaging, Grating, Prism, and Acquire
# are RESERVED names for special preset modes implemented as buttons
# on the MODS dashboard for the blue channel.  All presets, however,
# (including the 4 reserved names) are available at the command line
# or via scripts using the "RED CONFIG configName" command.
#
# The grating, filter, and ROI selections for a configuration may be
# either the numbered device position (for filter and grating) or a
# name.  If a name, it must be exactly as it appears in the respective
# device table (rgrating.tab, rfilter.tab, and ccdroi.tab).  If "Any"
# appears as a grating, filter, or ROI name it means to leave that
# setup unchanged when setting the mode.  Full-frame CCD readout is
# specified with the word "Full".
#
# The collimator TTF actuator positions are defined for each of the
# various modes, measured after finalizing the alignment of the
# dispersers.  For the grating modes, the TTF positions are for the
# primary grating position as listed in the corresponding rgrtiltN.tab
# file.  Acquire mode should have the same TTFs as Imaging mode.
#
# Custom configuration entries should come *AFTER* the 4 reserved
# configurations.  If you comment out a reserved configuration you
# effectively disable the corresponding GUI button

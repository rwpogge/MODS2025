  Sets up and initiates an exposure on the CCD camera.  It sets up and
  launches the exposure, returning control to the calling process for
  further monitoring and handling.  This allows the client to watch for
  abort directives either from the console or remote sockets.  The main
  client loop handles polling during exposures to monitor integration and
  readout progress, and then triggers the SaveImage() function to save
  the image.

  A Bias (or Zero) image is one in which the CCD is erased then readout
  immediately, giving a measurment of the 2-dimensional bias signal on
  the CCD that is a consequence of readout, not actual photons hitting
  the array.

  This function acquires a bias image by forcing the integration time to
  0.0sec, then taking an image that is immediately readout.  We bypass
  any integration countdown monitoring by setting the server state
  to READOUT immediately upon completion of the StartExposure call.

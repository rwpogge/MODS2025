# MODS Support Scripts

**Updated: 2025 Dec 23 [rwp/osu]**

## Overview

These are the general support scripts for the MODS spectrographs.
This set has been modified for the Archon controller system 
implemented in late 2025. MODS1 and MODS2 scripts have mostly
been merged since operations are identical for both instruments.

A few older scripts have been retired, but all of the pre-2025
scripts are in the `Pre2025/` folder for reference.

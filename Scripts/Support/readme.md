# MODS Support Scripts

**Updated: 2026 Jan 30 [rwp/osu]**

## Overview

These are the general support scripts for the MODS spectrographs.
This set has been modified for the Archon controller system 
implemented in late 2025. MODS1 and MODS2 scripts have mostly
been merged since operations are identical for both instruments.

A few older scripts have been retired, but all of the pre-2025
scripts are in the `Pre2025/` folder for reference.

 * `Eng` are engineering scripts for measuring CCD and telescope offset performance. This merges the CCD tests from the old `Eng/` folder and the `Dice5` offset tests.
 * `Pre2025` - the original suite of scripts

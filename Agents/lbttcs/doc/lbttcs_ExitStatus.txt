lbttcs Agent Exit Status Codes:
Updated: 2012 Sept 16 [rwp/osu]

Normal:
    0 = Execution terminated normally

Internal Errors:
  1x = Program runtime error:
       10 = Command-line syntax error
       11 = Could not load the runtime configuration file

  2x = ISIS client/server fault:
       20 = ISIS server connection initialization failed
       21 = ISIS client socket initialization failed

  3x = IIF/ICE interface fault:
       30 = ICE communications initialization failed

Relevant System Exit Codes (see /usr/include/bits/signum.h):

  134 = program exited after receiving the SIGABRT (abort) signal
  137 = program exited after receiving the SIGKILL (terminate immediately) signal.
  143 = program exited after receiving the SIGTERM (terminate) signal.

The SIGABRT signal is emitted when the Ice::ConnectionRefusedException is raised. 
If the IIF is aborted while the lbttcs is still running, the next TCS query will 
raise this exception and the lbttcs agent will exit with status 134 (128+SIGABRT).  
Similarly, if the lbttcs is started before the IIF is available, the first query
will raise this exception and then exit with code 134.

If the lbttcs agent is terminated by kill or killall (e.g., by "mods1 stop lbttcs"), 
exit status will be 143 (128+SIGTERM).

SIGKILL should be rare, and cannot be trapped.

Note: exit() emits 128+<signum> when termination is caused by receipt of
      a signal.

# MODS runtime config file

Last Update: 2025 Dec 20 [rwp/osu]

This directory contains the bash runtime configuration files for the MODS instrument
and Archon server user accounts (mods and observer)

 * `dot_bashrc.txt` - copy into `.bashrc`.  Sets up the paths for the `mods` and `observer` accounts to access MODS tools 
 * `vnc_config.txt` - copy into `~/.vnc/config` for our VNC config, but only if authorizing VNC for that user
 * `vnc_xstartup.txt` - copy into `~/.vnc/xstartup` for our VNC config, but only if authorizing VNC for that user

maybe more later...

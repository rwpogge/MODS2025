# Archon server runtime configuration files

Last Update: 2025 Oct 30 [rwp/osu]

This directory contains the runtime configuration files for the
Archon CCD controller servers: `mods1blue`, `mods1red`, `mods2blue`,
and `mods2red`.  This is a snapshop of the active configurations
on those machines.

Each MODS channel science CCD camera runs on a dedicated "Archon
server" machine, two per MODS. These two machines coordinate with a
third dedicated "instrument server" machine that runs the core
instrument control and data-acquisition, logging, and telemetry
systems.

These are working versions copied from the "flight" machines at
LBTO used for night-time observing and engineering operations.

# MODS public runtime configuration files

Last Update: 2025 July 16 [rwp/osu]

This directory contains the runtime configuration files released for MODS
observing operations.  

These should be fully vetted and working versions copied from templates maintined
deeper in the source code tree.  Applications run by users for LBT night-time
observing and engineering operations with MODS will reference these runtime
configuration files.

## Updating instructions

coming soon...

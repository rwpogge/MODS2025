Serial Port Configuration
2009 Mar 18

Before a general user can run any process that uses serial ports, the 
device permissions have to be set to allow them access.

Procedure:

0) Be root.

1) cd /etc/udev/permissions.d

2) edit 50-udev.permissions

Serial ports (either native to the MB or connected via a USB serial 
port converter) have root names /dev/ttyS on most systems.  Search 
for the line that looks like this

     # serial+dialup devices
     ttyS*:root:uucp:0660

and change the permission mask above from 0660 to 0666, then exit the
file.

3) Should work OK after a reboot, but you can finesse it on the short
run by setting chmod 0666 /dev/ttyS0

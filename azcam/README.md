# MODS azcam Server

Updated: 2025 Nov 21

## Overview

The MODS azcam server is basedo n Mike Lesser's `azcam` (https://github.com/mplesser/azcam) and `azcam-mods` (https://github.com/mplesser/azcam-mods),
but substantially modified.  While we are leaving the core `azcam` code mostly unmodified (see the release notes), `azcam-mods` is the focus of our development, 
and will not work on the MODS machines without our version of the core `azcam` code, which is why we bundle them together. Do not use the ITL/Lesser version of that.

See the release notes:
 * `azcam` [Release Notes](azcam/releases.md)
 * `azcam-mods` [Release Notes](azcam-mods/RELEASES.md)
 
for details.

Work in progress, stay tuned...

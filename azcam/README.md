# MODS AzCam Server

Our copy of Mike Lesser's `azcam` (https://github.com/mplesser/azcam) and `azcam-mods` (https://github.com/mplesser/azcam-mods).

While we are leaving the core `azcam` code alone, `azcam-mods` is the focus of our development.  We are, however, reserving
the possiblity we will have no choice but to start changing `azcam` core code, so we bundle these together.

Work in progress, stay tuned...

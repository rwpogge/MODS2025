# MODS AzCam Server

Updated: 2025 Sept 23

## Overview

Our copy of Mike Lesser's `azcam` (https://github.com/mplesser/azcam) and `azcam-mods` (https://github.com/mplesser/azcam-mods).

While we are leaving the core `azcam` code alone and `azcam-mods` is the focus of our development, we are   We are reserving the possiblity 
of modifying the `azcam` server proper if we have no other alterative.  This is why we are bundling them together.

One important note: our version of the core `azcam` code has changed only once to fix a break/continue bug in a loop.  Our version
of `azcam-mods` has significantly diverged - do not use the ITL/Lesser version of that.

See separate notes under both `azcam` and `azcam-mods` for details.

Work in progress, stay tuned...

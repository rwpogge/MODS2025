MODS azcam Notes

## 2025 Dec 16 [ml/itl]

Added `azcam-console` to the MODS2025 repository. Based on Mike's original GitHub repository version, this has
changes to enable it to work on an AlmaLinux9 system.  This is the version we need to keep updated moving
forward to support MODS with the Archons.
 * `utils.py` - isolated Windows functions, added beep for posix/Linux

## Notes

This version was adapted from Mike Lesser's original github version (https://github.com/mplesser/azcam-console.git) for 
engineering work on the MODS2025 Archon controller upgrade.  It was one of the first times the azcam-console package
was used on an AlmaLinux 9 system, so has diverged in from Mike's original.

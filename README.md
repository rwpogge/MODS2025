## Overview
MODS2025 Project to update MODS1+2 CCD and instrument control systems at the LBT

**This our very messy working repository, not the final flight code repository that will be built later.  
Proceed at your own risk**

However, it is taking on many of the structures of the real thing, so not totally sloppy.  Sort of.

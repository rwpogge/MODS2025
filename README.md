# MODS2025
Version 1.2.1

Last Update: 2025 Sept 21[rwp/osu]

Lead: Richard Pogge (OSU Astronomy) pogge.1@osu.edu

## Overview
MODS2025 Project to update MODS1+2 CCD and instrument control systems at the LBT

**This our very messy working repository, not the final flight code repository that will be built later.  
Proceed at your own risk**

However, it is taking on many of the structures of the real thing, so not totally sloppy.  Sort of.

## Contents

  * `mods` - MODS instrument control and data-acquisition system
  * `ISIS` - ISIS message-passing server and client
  * `azcam` - AzCam server for the MODS Archon CCD controllers
  * `Config` - MODS instance runtime configuration files released for observing operations
  * `Scripts` - Startup and status scripts (coming soon...)
  * `Sandbox` - place to put test codes and other bits we are using, the action is in the subfolders

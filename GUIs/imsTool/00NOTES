ims_v10 (rgonzale@astonomy.ohio-state.edu) 12-2011

This is the first instance of the ims code. It is written in Qt4
and is used to test and/or interrogate microLynx PLC microcode with a
microLynx controller with or without hardware.

 This GUI is self-explanatory but just incase:

[File] - load a file. DO NOT SAVE A FILE to many drawbacks
[Edit] - Edit a file if needed as a test plc file
[View] - NOT working properly
[Transfer] - upLoad a file from the File window to MicroLynx 
	     controller, or downLoad a file from the MicroLynx controller 
	     to the File window.
[Help] - Help button

[Find]         - find a file
[ IP ]         - input for the IP address                        
[Socket]       - Port number
[clearNVM]     - This clears the previous PLC microcode from the MicroLynx
                 memory
[Open Socket]  - Open the IP:Socket
[Close Socket] - Close the socket

The IMS Terminal window shows the command send and the reponse.

v11 - Raymond Gonzalez (OSU) 11-16-2012 [rdg]
	* Added sensible comments to the code.
	* Made the GUI more user friendly.
	* Enhanced the IMS Terminal window by introducing microLynx Errors
	  numbers and messages.
	  (the PC-IMS version form IMS Corp. does not have)
	* Removed [Download] item from [Transfer] menu item (too dangerous).
	* reworked the [upLoad] and input commands to match PC-IMS. The first
	  version was done in a hurry.

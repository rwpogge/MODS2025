# iTerm - ICIMACS terminal

iTerm is a Qt4 GUI that implements a "terminal" style command interface to 
communicate with the MODS instrument control system at the ICIMACS
command protocol level (aka "bare metal").

It connects to the local isis server with UDP sockets and handles command
and response traffic.
